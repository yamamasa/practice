<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>

<p>GitHub pages uses Jekyll natively, so when I make documentation, I typically
look for Jekyll templates. Why? Using Jekyll means that I can use markdown,
and allow for users to easily contribute, and build automatically just by
way of pushing to a master branch (or general GitHub pages).
I found Docsy, a beautiful Hugo template, but it requires hugo with GoLang
which doesn’t render natively on GitHub pages. For this reason, I’ve spent
some time creating a custom Jekyll template that is (almost) as beautiful,
and includes all the features that I might want.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>What are these features? You should see the <a href="/docs/getting-started">Getting Started</a></p>

<p>guide for a complete summary. Briefly:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>User interaction</em> including consistent permalinks, links to ask questions via GitHub issues, and edit the file on GitHub directly.</li>
  <li><em>Search</em> across posts, documentation, and other site pages, with an ability to exclude from search.</li>
  <li><em>External Search</em> meaning an ability to link any page tag to trigger an external search.</li>
  <li><em>Documentation</em> A documentation collection that was easy to organize on the filesystem, render with nested headings for the user, and refer to in markdown.</li>
  <li><em>Pages</em> A separate folder for more traditional pages (e.g, about).</li>
  <li><em>Navigation</em>: Control over the main navigation on the left of the page, and automatic generation of table of contents for each page on the right.</li>
  <li><em>News</em> A posts feed for news and updates, along with an archive (organized by year).</li>
  <li><em>Templates</em> or specifically, “includes” that make it easy to create an alert, documentation link, or other content.</li>
  <li><em>Continuous Integration</em> recipes to preview the site</li>
</ul>
